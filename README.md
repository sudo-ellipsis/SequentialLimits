# Sequential Limits - an in-development Exponential Idle custom theory

A work-in-progress theory designed around the exploitation and concept of approximation limits.
Be careful - the closer your approximation of Euler's number is, the less your numerator grows!
A close balancing game, fun for the whole family (or at least, the ones who play exponential idle). Using Stirling's approximation of Euler's number, hone your approximation while balancing the growth of your variables and currencies. The formula, named after James Stirling and first stated by Abraham De Moivre, states that ln(n!) can be approximated by the infinite sum ln(1) + ln(2) .... + ln(n), and thus e can be approximated with a little rearranging.

Special thanks to:
- Gilles-Phillipe, for development of the custom theory SDK, implementing features I requested, providing countless script examples, and help with my numerous questions and balancing.
- Xelaroc/AlexCord, for answering every one of my questions, debugging and helping me understand how to balance a theory, and porting this to the standard C++ theory simulator.
- The Exponential Idle beta testing team
- The Exponential Idle localisation and translation team, who's work I added to. 

Best of luck!
