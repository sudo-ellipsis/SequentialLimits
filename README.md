# Sequential Limits - an Exponential Idle custom theory

You're the first student, and after your professor retired, you're given the mantle of chief researcher. Eager to dive into fields where your old professor dove off, you start looking into the concept explored in the seventh lemma - sequential limits - to further your career.

This theory explores the concept of approximations, using a rearrangment of Stirling's Formula to approximate Euler's number.
The formula, named after James Stirling and first stated by Abraham De Moivre, states that ln(n!) can be approximated by the infinite sum ln(1) + ln(2) .... + ln(n).
Be careful - the closer your approximation of Euler's number is, the less your numerator grows!
A close balancing game, fun for the whole family (or at least, the ones who play exponential idle). 

Best of luck!
